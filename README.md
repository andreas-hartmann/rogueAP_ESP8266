# rogueAP_ESP8266
This is a simple proof of concept Rogue Access Point for ESP8266. It will pose as a public Wifi network and entice victims into entering an email address and an often reused password. The credentials are stored on flash and are printed to serial on startup. They are also accessible on 192.168.4.1/credentials. This AP intercepts DNS requests to act as a captive portal. Most modern operating systems will recognize this and redirect the user straight to a login page. Recommended configuration would be 80MHz mode with 3MB flash. Since no HTTPS is used, 80MHz should be sufficient and reduce power consumption. OTA is not supported, so the extra flash space can be used to store more credentials.
